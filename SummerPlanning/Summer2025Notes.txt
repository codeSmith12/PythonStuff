Subject: WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE SUMMER

1. DEVICES: 
    Devices need to be recycled
    Before recycling, look at our needs, make sure we have enough 
    Using the now empty boxes, I need to format the Chromebook boxes (CB-01-A, ect.)
    After Chromebooks are done, it’s time to do a “passthrough” of each of the boxes we want to send out for summer
    This means I need to know the quantity of each device that I’ll need, so we can make sure to prepare that many boxes (maybe + a box or two?)
    -Looking at my calculations of what we need, it leaned pretty heavily on the macbooks. 
    -We need to format the macbooks/TP to be ready to work if the browser stuff doesn't work properly...


2. INSTRUCTOR STUFF:
    Pressing: I need to quantify where everyone is, and look at which area of the Bay Area I am lacking instructors on. 
    This will help me understand how many people I need to hire, and for which areas I should look.

    I will have to construct a schedule for the instructors.

    Things to consider:
    Desire to teach subject
    Enjoyment of age group
    Location

    Google Form for Scheduling:
    Which of the following subjects do you have interest in?
    Which age groups do you enjoy or think you’d enjoy working with?
    Are you okay with driving X minutes to work?
    (What city do you reside in? We already have this info)



What else do I need to do for summer:
Devices - recycling, preparing, look at what we have vs what we need
instructors - hiring, scheduling, training
Maybe curriculum? Like Roblox or Minecraft...
