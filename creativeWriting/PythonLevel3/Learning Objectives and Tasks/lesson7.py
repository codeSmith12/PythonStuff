Python Level 3 - Lesson 7 - Building our Backend

Learning Objectives:
    - Learn how to simulate transactions
    - Learn how to add error messages (if the player doesn't have enough money) 
    - Learn how to calculate a "chance of occurence", with the luck stat triggering only when certain conditions are made
    - The difference between front end and back end coding
    - How to use the window.after() function to call something periodically
    - What is recursion? Why are we using it in this project?
    
   

Lesson Tasks:
    Note: Students can code this in any order but it's wise to start with the simplest purchases first
    - Talk about a general order of things to do during a transaction
        Decide what you want to purchase, check if you have money, if so, give upgrade and take money, else, inform user they need money
        Update display with new stat change
    - Start the user off with 1000000 score so we can test purchases
    - Code the first part of the click multiplier upgrade (every click is +1 more), test!
    - Code passive income functions(buyPassive, passiveProc and buyTickSpeed), make sure it only starts once the purchase has been made
    - Add code for luck stat to the clicker. Start with 50% luck for testing.
    - Code purchase luck stat, talk about how this happens due to random chance
    - Code Critical Multiplier function
    - Add function to update the whole display of stats
