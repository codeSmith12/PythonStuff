Lesson Tasks:

    Extra: If desired, you can have each upgrade scale in cost. This should probably be cheaper for the lower upgrades.
    It can be something like upgradeCost += upgradeCost *.05 per transaction.
    Think of limits to your upgrades. For example, the TICKSPEED upgrade should not exceed a number that will cause the game to lag or crash
    Upon reaching the maximum, perhaps you should deactivate the button.
    Sound effects are a fun way to bring life to your games. We can explore methods for making sounds
