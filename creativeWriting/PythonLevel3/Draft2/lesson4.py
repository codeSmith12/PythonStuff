Python Level 3 - Lesson 4 - High Score List

Objectives:
    - Discuss why having sorted data is often optimal
    - Understand that sorting objects themselves is not useful, we need to learn how to sort by their data (member variables)
    - Show syntax for sorting by an objects variables 
    - Explain Lambda (needs research...)

Tasks:
    - Discussion on sorting data
    - Discussion on how objects themselves are pieces of memory and sorting the objects doesn't work
    - Sort our current projects data by Score
    - Because this lesson may be light, we can show students more TK widgets they might be using.
    - Tying into the homework, we can show them the rest of the widgets and what they do (overview)
    - ^^ Need to show the students what a Frame is, which allows us to group multiple widgets into 1 grid spot
    - Students will need to practice with grid.

Homework:
    Using whatever method you'd like (or maybe use 1 tech), design what you have in mind for your games UI.
    Students will need to come up with what widgets are needed for each piece of the UI. 
    They will need to clearly label each widget with it's type, as well as it's contents. 
    
    ____
    Or we teach them about grid ?
