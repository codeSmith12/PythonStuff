'''
Python Level 3 - Lesson 1 - Object Oriented Programming (OOPs I Did It Again)

Objectives:
    - Learn what the benefits are of an OOP approach
    - Learn why we would group data together inside of objects
    - Touch on the subject of encapsulation
    - Learn what the syntax is for creating an object
    - How to access data, and call member functions
    - Enlighten students that they've been using it all along (Show them turtle, random, math)

Tasks:
    - Create a Person object
    - Understand what an init function does. Example on slides might be initializing a game, setting scores to 0 and such
    - Using this class, create 3-5 Person objects, with different data
    - Understand how to access an objects data (person1.name)
    - Create a member function that allows the person to introduce themselves


Homework:
    Practice objectifying objects around the house
    Each object needs to have at least 1 member variable and 1 member function
    Students are encouraged to think of what data might go into these member functions, and what their output might be
    It is okay at this point to use print statements to describe what the function would do
