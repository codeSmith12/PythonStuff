    - Learn what GUI stands for, what is tkinter

    - Learn what pack() does
    - Try a few attributes of the label

Tasks:
    - Create a window, set the dimensions and understand how to keep the window open
    - Create a label, format it, pack it
    - View the different attributes using the link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-tkinter-label/ (or slides)
    - Using the objects ToStr() function, update labels text to hold persons data
    - If time allows, group objects together in list, loop through list adding data into label
    - If time allows further, create an "Entry" object that takes in a person and adds to the window
