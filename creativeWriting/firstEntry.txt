hello

It feels weird to use VS Code for non-coding tasks. But maybe it'll be helpful. Mostly, it will be stored in my github.
If for some reason someone else besides me reads this, hello. Hopefully you can excuse my cringe writing. We all have to start somewhere.

I'm currently in a starbucks just trying to see if this is something I'd like to do with my free time.
My main purpose of creative writing is to get better at telling stories for my music.



----------
What topics would I like to write about?
I could write about my alcoholism...
About the path that I've walked. The hurdles I've over come.

or
about the happiness that I've experienced. With friends, exploration, honing of skills.
I could pull from my list of song titles. 

1. Melt - A story about how two people combine into 1 when they're in a relationship (maybe a co-dependent one)
- Sometimes you don't realize you're melting with someone. (boiling frog esk)
    -Gravity of attraction leads you to the oven, passion turns up the thermostat
- After melting with someone, you are permanently disfigured or warped (mostly mentally of course)
    - I still leave space for Mel on the bed for some reason.
- There's an aspect of losing a part of yourself, while gaining a part of the other.  (maybe an exchange)
    - I lost having free time, but gained the ability to contribute to something besides myself.
- It's hard to pull apart after melting with someone. You've become fused, chemically bonded
    - Used to have someone to share my excitement with, now its just bottled.
    - Melting became self destructive. It was hard for me to leave Mel towards the end.
    - Blocking her severed the connection, which actually made my life much easier. Felt relief
- Sometimes you don't survive the melting process, you both burn. 
- End up as a puddle, not even closely resembling who you were before.
