hello

It feels weird to use VS Code for non-coding tasks. But maybe it'll be helpful. Mostly, it will be stored in my github.
If for some reason someone else besides me reads this, hello. Hopefully you can excuse my cringe writing. We all have to start somewhere.

I'm currently in a starbucks just trying to see if this is something I'd like to do with my free time.
My main purpose of creative writing is to get better at telling stories for my music.



----------
What topics would I like to write about?
I could write about my alcoholism...
About the path that I've walked. The hurdles I've over come.

or
about the happiness that I've experienced. With friends, exploration, honing of skills.
I could pull from my list of song titles. 

1. Melt - A story about how two people combine into 1 when they're in a relationship (maybe a co-dependent one)

- Sometimes you don't realize you're melting with someone. (boiling frog esk)
It all started with our first date. Two frogs in a pot. Gravity of attraction brought us here,
while passion has turned on the burner.
    -Gravity of attraction leads you to the oven, passion turns up the thermostat

- After melting with someone, you are permanently disfigured or warped (mostly mentally of course)
    - I still leave space for Mel on the bed for some reason.

- There's an aspect of losing a part of yourself, while gaining a part of the other.  (maybe an exchange)
    - I lost having free time, but gained the ability to contribute to something besides myself (a relationship)
    ^ Essentially walking a different path now. One was to 100% self improvement, the other towards building a relationship (I understand that they'r not mutually exclusive but your path is probably warped by your relationship, lets be honest.)

- It's hard to pull apart after melting with someone. You've become fused, chemically bonded
    - Used to have someone to share my excitement with, now its just bottled.
    As I Melt, I bubble with excitement. Now I bottle with ..... something?
    - Melting became self destructive. It was hard for me to leave Mel towards the end.
    - Blocking her severed the connection, which actually made my life much easier. Felt relief
    (With a single stroke, I cut us in two. Taking parts of me and parts of you.)

- Sometimes you don't survive the melting process, you both burn... ("Learn" rhymes with burn...)

- End up as a puddle, not even closely resembling who you were before.

Question:
Do we make it general (about people in general) or specific (about me)
I feel like general is better. I can use the word "you" to speak to the audience, and 
"they" to talk about the partner?

I dont think we want this to be a happy ending type of thing.
Could maybe end on the note of I am ready to melt again?
In light of everything, still wanting to melt is maybe the right take away
"Better to have love and lost than never to have loved at all" type shiii


Song structure and topics:
1. How it began
    a. First date, gravity of attraction brought us here
    b. With each kiss the oven heats up
    c. Two frogs, floating in the pot. Not yet noticed it's hot
2. Beginning to melt
    a. Losing parts of yourself. Your schedule, your goals, your tastes, your clothes
    b. We get to build something together
    c. 
3. Fully melted
    a. Chemically bonded, an exchange of selves, living as one, no escape
    

4. Break the Bond
    (With a single stroke, I cut us in two. Taking parts of me and parts of you.)
    I cant pretend it wasn't a relief, it's finally time to turn a new leaf(?) - kinda trash



5. Post Melting
    a. Warped and disfigured, I lie on my bed, 
    b. you're still in my head,

6. Sign-off



First attempt at writing lyrics:

2. Toxic Love - Story about Mikayla
What do I want to cover:
Emotion sickness
Abuse
Fighting, how she used to go for the throat...
The ultimate tiping point (BassCanyon)
Dilectible body though...
Thank you Mikayla, for showing me what I don't want.
I hope you're doing well, (but I kinda don't.)
