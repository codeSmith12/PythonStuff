Roblox Level 1 Overview:

1. Introductions
  a. Introduce yourself, establish credit as a teacher / programmer
  b. Have each student ask 3/4 questions(of your choosing)

    -> What is your first name? (pronunciation)
    -> What grade are you in? (age / maturity)
    -> What programming experience do you have? (How you can talk about concepts)
    -> What is your favorite game on Roblox? (Connection)

    As you're gathering information from the first 3 questions,
      attempt humor & try to connect to them. If you are perceived as friendly
      and not just a superior / authority, they will be more open to share with you
      and ask for help. The last question allows you to learn about the types of
      games your student is in to and establish a connection with comments
      about those games
